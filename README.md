# ETL-Pipeline-for-Fetching-Public-API-Data-and-Storing-in-MySQL
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to fetch country-related data from a public API, transform it into a structured format, and store it in a MySQL database. The pipeline extracts data, converts it into a Pandas DataFrame, and inserts it into a MySQL table.
